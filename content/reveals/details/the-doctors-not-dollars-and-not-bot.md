In order to begin, I (that is, _Johnny C_) must explain that Dr. Not Dollars (aka {{< docnotdollars >}}) and Dr. Not Bot (aka {{< docnotbot >}}) are not "real".

Rather, they are figurative projections of _two versions of myself that could have been_, had I made different decisions in life.

### Dr. Not Dollars == {{< docnotdollars >}}

Dr. Not Dollars, for instance, is a washed-up almost-was of a rapper who peaked with his 2004 hit "Yorns Out". Ironically enough, the song was an ode to his (Johnny C's) unstoppable affinity for achieving dreams without much effort.

That smug attitude spoiled the waters towards his next efforts, which were not helped by poor production choices that were reportedly all his own doing.

Now, after a decade and a half of nursing the wounds of his previous mistakes, Dr. Not Dollars managed to find his footing in the funk, once again.

### Dr. Not Bot == {{< docnotbot >}}

Dr. Not Bot is the version of Johnny C who used the credit union loan to purchase Apple stock in 1999 -- rather than that candy gray G4 tower and matching Cinema Screen that _I_ chose to spend it on.

Like me, he has a Masters Degree in New Media. Unlike me, he got it from MIT, on the way through his PhD.

He was living a life fueled by notions of progress that slowly became less and less familiar, until one day he woke up and realized that he would have to choose a different path.

There could be no other way around it: Not Bot's life focus could no longer remain on the bottom line of a corporate ledger.

It was in that moment that he decided to create Not Bot Labs, where he works on _human tools for electronic music_.

### Name It

I believe in the power of _names_ _(Ed: Proper writing on the topic to come)_. Through the knowledge and use of a name, that which is named can come to be molded and shaped by the knower and user of the name.

Through these cartoonish formulations that I've developed a different relationship to my decisions in life, which previously might be colored by dark lenses of regret.

In other words, it's just a bit of fun. I hope it doesn't upset you too much, unless it upsets you quite a lot -- at which point, all the Johnny C's on this page are laughing loudly in your honor, and more besides.
