[LIVE! At the End of an Era](https://soundcloud.com/botnotbot/live-at-the-end-of-an-era) represents a huge turning point for myself, personally. While I was never shy of stages--having bum rushed quite a few, including a 2006 Macklemore set in Olympia, WA--I wasn't _ready_ for them.

The turning point is that, now, I feel that I _finally_ am up to the responsibilities of live performance.

This set was prepared under 72 hours notice of my last opportunity to perform in the wonderful garden of a friends (ex-)home. It was something that had been discussed for ages, but hadn't happened yet.

They lyrics are primarily freestyled, I'd say about 85-95% completely unscripted and off the top. That has been my bread and butter (_Ed: origin stories incoming soon_) from the age of 18, whereas I only gained the confidence to become the music man of my own power duo (aka stopped waiting for my DJ Premiere or Dr. Dre) much more recently.

However, I plan for this to be my **last set** that relies so heavily on improvised lyrics -- the starting, written words to [The Platform Rap (Zuckerburg, Sucker City)](https://soundcloud.com/botnotbot/live-at-the-end-of-an-era#t=27:20) are my favorite of the night.

This set is a testament to over a decade of practice, funneled through a hasty set with a custom filter that never quite worked the way it was planned to, where there was any plan at all.

I'll sort out how to embed songs directly soon, but for now please have a listen to [LIVE! At the End of an Era](https://soundcloud.com/botnotbot/live-at-the-end-of-an-era) directly on SoundCloud.
