I've been rapping under the name Ceasless since around 2003, essentially when I first started. So it's no surprise that when I joined SoundCloud as [Ceasless](https://soundcloud.com/ceasless) in 2013.

However, for a good while now all the tracks on the Ceasless page have been tagged as Bot/Notbot. With the release of [LIVE! At the End of an Era](/releases/music/live-at-the-end-of-an-era), it seemed appropriate to start fresh. It's a bit daunting to be starting all over, but then again there's nothing like the smell of a new home.

Follow Bot/Notbot at our official home on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/botnotbot)!
