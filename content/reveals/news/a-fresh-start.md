I've been rapping under the name Ceasless since around 2003, a year after I first started rapping. So it's no surprise that when I joined SoundCloud as [Ceasless](https://soundcloud.com/ceasless) a decade later, when diving seriously into production for the first time in 2013.

The account has served me well, serving out over two thousand listens to friends and fans around the world.

One day I hope to see those kinds of numbers on a single song, but I'm already so happy to have gotten the love I've already received.

In honor of Ceasless' SoundCloud, here is one of his earliest tracks, "Uncertain Stars", which is still the song with the most plays to date.

However, for a good while now all the tracks on the Ceasless page have been tagged as Bot/Notbot. This is related to stylistic as well as artistic progression.

For instance, here is a demo of a Bot/Notbot song called "Grind Mordagan":

The Doctors agree that there has been a great deal of growth since "Uncertain Stars" (and perhaps you do too).

With the release of [Bot/NotBot - LIVE! At the End of an Era](/releases/music/live-at-the-end-of-an-era), it seemed appropriate to start fresh. It's a bit daunting to begin all over again, but there's truly nothing like the smell of a _fresh start_.

Follow Bot/Notbot at the official home on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/botnotbot)!
