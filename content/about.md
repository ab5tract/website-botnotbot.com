What happens when multiple versions of a person find themselves together in a single, converged timeline? That's what the two Johnny C variants known to this world as _Dr. Not Dollars_ and _Dr. Not Bot_ are about to find out!

_Johnny C_ is an artist living dual lives as a computer programmer and a musical creature of the night in Amsterdam. He is no longer content to live a life of internalized expression at high volumes.
