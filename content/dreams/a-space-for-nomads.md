conjunction: "about"
description: "For all the prototypical thousands of years of so-called 'pre-history', humans who lived a life of movement without staying in one place were the rule â€” not the exception. I dream of a day when the world views of this original lifestyle are better understood. There are stories still maintained today representing unbroken oral traditions going back millennia."

How do you feel visiting a zoo?

Since I was a child, it has plunged me into dark depressive obsessions about the incompatibility of "nature" and "civilization" (at least as far as we are currently able to achieve it).

All of those once-wild animals, swaying on their legs in the last places allotted them by the logic of Civilized.

The world was once entirely nomadic. Please, let that sink in for a second.

You (ie, the vast majority of people who still equate 'nomad' with 'savage', and maintain a space of violent 'Wild' in their brutal imaginaria) cannot be blamed for your ignorance of "primitive" mindsets, philosophies, and pedagogies.

However, it should still behoove you to question your understanding of nomadic culture. Who wrote the descriptions of the tribes in those textbooks in school? How much space, let alone _credence_, have the OGP _(Ed: Original Gathering Peoples)_ world view ever been granted in the "court" of public opinion?

Little, and less...

Important to note, as the power of controlling the _narrative_ of the "Native" **is** the power of controlling the "nomad".

### Interesting Reading

- [Bajou Sea Nomads](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/bajau-sea-nomads-free-diving-spleen-science/?sf187339380=1) can no longer afford to live in the sea, as industrial fishing removes their local stock to below subsistence levels. They are genetically aligned to survive longer under water than any other humans on the planet, achieved partially by having a large spleen.

- Neither Wolf Nor Dog and The Twilight Moon are two vital books for anyone who isn't familiar with the genocidal policies of the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Policies which in some cases remain in place today.
