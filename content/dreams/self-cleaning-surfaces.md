## Why it matters to me

There are arguably few things on this earth as inefficient or haphazard than the manner in which we clean up after ourselves.

Social rules of politeness would ask that we not even raise the topic for discussion.

While molecular manufacturing implies that yesterday's garbage heap becomes tomorrow's raw material, the impact of self-cleaning surfaces has the potential to completely up-end entire social hierarchies.

Even the smallest scale deployment of these technologies could have devastating effects on economies worldwide, where there are entire underclasses largely employed in janitorial roles.

However, it _also_ has the potential to drastically alter just about every dynamic of daily maintenance, if not entire social hierarchies. Let me explain.

### Women worldwide are forced to clean

Not only is janitorial work labor intensive, in its unpaid form it is largely considered "women's work" and thus involves labor extracted based on entirely biogeographical factors.

That is, depending on where you are born and the flip of a coin, you could be cleaning up after ungrateful bastards your entire life.

No more suds, bring on the self-cleaning surfaces!
