When people speak of "freedom", they are usually speaking in economic terms. That was the rhetoric for the entire George W Bush administration, for instance.

It is a central conceit of the libertarian to equate freedom with the _freedom to own_ rather than the _freedom to **not** be owned_.

According to that definition, it is indeed true that freedom and democracy are incompatible: _economic freedom_ is corporate personhood, economic freedom is Hobby Lobby and Citizens United.

Economic freedom is _"money talks"_.

Economic freedom is the right to take as much as you can, whatever the cost to others.

Economic freedom is about the right to never pay for what cannot be measured.

It should be obvious that such an approach would be incompatible with a democratic society in the long run.

[Economic democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_democracy) is a socioeconomic philosophy dedicated to imagining a way to achieve economic equality and, as a result, political democracy.
