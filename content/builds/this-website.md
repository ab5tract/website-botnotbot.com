_(Note to reader: a longer form introduction to Doctor Not $$$'s relationship to software will be arriving momentarily. Please stay tuned for a link here when it arrives.)_

The bones of this website are available free of charge at [github.com](https://github.com/notbotlabs/website-botnotbot.com). It currently uses the (most excellent!) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static-site framework _(ed: The software category needs a better name)_ to easily manage this entire website. The [theme](https://github.com/notbotlabs/theme-hugo-crower) is based off of [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) by Luis de Pr√°.

By the way, this website is 100% JavaScript free _(ed: at least for the time being.. we will see if it is possible to embed SoundCloud or Spotify without JS... :( )_.
