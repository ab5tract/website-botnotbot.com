Reason is relatively new to my life, but it's hard to downplay how inspiring it has been for me. Though I have previously argued strongly against skeuomorphism in software, Reason's recreation of a physical rack (down to purely cosmetic fans and power cables) has sucked me in.

I've been wanting to get into plugin development for some time now and have decided to take the plunge with a simple ADSR envelope.

While this might seem a bit plain, it's actually based on a gap I currently see in the market. None of the EGs I've looked at have been dealing with CV control of all 4 stages of the envelope.

This would be useful in the case of using something like the absolutely wonderful [Distributor](https://shop.propellerheads.se/rack-extension/distributor/).

_More details to come, until then here's a an image..._
